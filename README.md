# NodePlugin
An experimental node based vst effect.

Todo:<br>
add more waves: triangle, saw<br>
better selection (eg. selecting multiple nodes, selecting connections, etc...)<br>
check on how the settings will be saved(when you reload the project in the daw), and if I need to export the entire thing to json, etc...<br>
find compatability of sdl with actual correct vst graphics interfaces<br>
add more interesting nodes(maybe reverb, fft, compressor, etc...)<br>
get the C code generation(with tcc) working(currently unable to find libtcc.a on windos systems even when it seems to be in the right place)<br>
